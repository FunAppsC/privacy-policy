<h2>3. Legal Basis for Processing (EEA / GDPR)</h2>

<p>
If you are located in the European Economic Area (EEA), our legal basis for collecting and using the personal
information described in this Privacy Policy depends on the data concerned and the specific context in which
we collect it.
</p>

<p>
Third-party partners such as Google may process personal data based on one or more of the following legal bases:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Your consent (for personalized advertising where required)</li>
  <li>Performance of a contract (to provide their services)</li>
  <li>Compliance with a legal obligation</li>
  <li>Legitimate interests (such as fraud prevention, service improvement, and security)</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>4. International Data Transfers</h2>

<p>
Third-party service providers may process and store information on servers located outside
your country or jurisdiction, including in the United States and other countries.
Data protection laws in those jurisdictions may differ from those in your country.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>5. User Rights (EEA and Other Regions)</h2>

<p>
Depending on your location, you may have the following data protection rights:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>The right to access, update, or delete your personal information</li>
  <li>The right to object to processing</li>
  <li>The right to restrict processing</li>
  <li>The right to data portability</li>
  <li>The right to withdraw consent at any time</li>
</ul>

<p>

and the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA), including the right to request information about the
collection, use, and disclosure of your personal information.
</p>

<p>
Because the App does not directly collect personal information, requests related to personal data
should be directed to the applicable third-party service providers, such as Google.

secure and reliable, and we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>11. Data Retention</h2>
